  description: `Developed a flexible solar panel deployment concept for e-rickshaws supporting street vendors in Bihar, India, enabling on-the-go power with lightweight, adaptable hardware.`,
  achievements: [
    'Designed lightweight panel mounting concept tailored to e-rickshaw geometry',
    'Explored deployable hinge mechanisms for rapid setup and stowage',
    'Collaborated with research mentors to scope pilot testing in Bihar'
  ],
  skills: [
    'Product design',
    'Human-centered research',
    'Energy systems',
    'Prototype fabrication',
    'Field deployment planning'

      title: 'Prototype Approach',
      content: `I created a modular frame and hinge system that folds alongside the vehicle when driving, then opens to maximize surface area when parked. Early prototypes emphasized low-profile mounting, intuitive operation, and compatibility with available panels.`
