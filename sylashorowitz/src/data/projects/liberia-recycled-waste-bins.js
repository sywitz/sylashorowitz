  description: `Co-created waste collection concepts with the Environmental Rescue Initiative (ERI) in Liberia, converting heat-fused plastic water sachets into durable bins while documenting build guides the partner can deploy locally.`,
  achievements: [
    'Partnered with ERI to define community-centered design criteria for waste bins',
    'Produced project summary plus detailed steel-frame and wire-frame build guides for local fabricators',
    'Applied user-centered research to align aesthetics, durability, and educational impact with community needs'

      content: `Liberian communities are inundated with discarded plastic water sachets. Working with ERI, our team sought to create recognizable value from that waste stream by designing waste bins that could be built locally and withstand daily use.`

      title: 'Project Summary',
      content: `In a four-person team I contributed to a comprehensive project summary covering problem framing, stakeholder insights, and implementation planning. We emphasized low-cost fabrication, ease of maintenance, and educational storytelling to encourage adoption.`

      title: 'Steel Frame Bin',
      content: `Independently, I developed a steel frame bin concept sized for a standard collection point. The design uses welded steel members to provide stiffness while leaving room for the heat-fused sachet panels. Detailed drawings explain assembly, fasteners, and ways ERI can source components.`

    {
      title: 'Wire Frame Bin',
      content: `A complementary wire frame version reduces material mass and simplifies tooling requirements. I documented the bend patterns, panel attachment points, and finishing options so ERI can choose the right balance of cost, durability, and manufacturability.`
