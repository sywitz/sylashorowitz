      title: 'Rebooting the Next Big Thing',
      content: `After several dormant years, I relaunched the Next Big Thing student group to create a headlining attraction for incoming freshmen. With an all-new roster, we set ambitious goals for safety, engagement, budget discipline, and volunteer-friendly construction.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Concept Development',
      content: `We brainstormed ideas that ranged from freefalls to ziplines before converging on a renaissance castle that could host interactive stations like candle making, paint jousting, corn hole, and theatrical skits. The concept needed to serve hundreds of students in short visits and transform Orientation into an immersive experience.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Architecture & Layout',
      content: `Our final layout featured two hexagonal towers connected by an elevated bridge and working drawbridge. The interior supported craft activities while the rooftop platform staged jousting games. Modular wall panels and the drawbridge allowed the structure to seal safely after hours.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Collaborative CAD & Engineering',
      content: `I led the Autodesk Fusion 360 model focusing on tower geometry, floor blocking, and modular wall construction. Floor joists stayed within OSHA's 12 in spacing requirement, while ceiling ties reinforced the 15 ft walls. I delegated bridge, guardrail, and drawbridge subassemblies and coordinated frequent design reviews to keep the team aligned.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Documentation & Approvals',
      content: `We produced a full set of dimensioned engineering drawings and structural calculations for review. MIT EHS, BMC Engineering, and Cambridge authorities approved the plans, with additional documentation prepared for a future "structural integrity analysis" download once the build resumed post-COVID.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Construction & Mentorship',
      content: `During the build phase I coached about 15 volunteers on saws, drills, and safe work practices. Weather delays and lumber issues forced us to prioritize completing one tower, but the experience reinforced rapid decision making and collaborative problem solving under tight deadlines.`
